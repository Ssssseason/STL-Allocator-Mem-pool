# STL Allocator + Mem pool 

Final project for OOP course, where we implement **STL allocator for P.J. STL, based on memory pool**.
### Source code
In folder `myTest` is latest project built by VS 2017, feel free to do her.
### Implement details
In folder `report` is our report, including project background, goal, detailed algorithm implement and performance tests. We believe file `report.pdf` suits most needs for more information, but we also provided `report.tex` and all result pictures. 
### Performance test
Besides, if you'd like to test some other harder datasets, you can just  adjust parameters in `testdatagen.py` and generate own test dataset.
